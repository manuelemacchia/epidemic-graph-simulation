# Epidemic simulation on graph

## Overview
The goal is to learn the network characteristics and disease dynamics of the pandemic occurred in Sweden during 2009, commonly known as [swine flu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_swine_flu_pandemic). As a secondary goal, we develop an algorithm to simulate an epidemic on a random graph of choice according to the SIR and SIRV models.

## Usage
### Simulate SIR/SIRV on a random graph
`simulate.py`

### Simulate the Sweden 2009 pandemic
`simulate.py`

## Notes
This project has been assigned as a problem in the Network Dynamics and Learning course at the Polytechnic University of Turin, during A.Y. 2020/2021.

All numbers regarding the H1N1 pandemic in Sweden during the fall of 2009 have been taken from the report by the Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency (*Myndigheten för samhällsskydd och beredskap*, MSB) and the Swedish Institute for Communicable Disease Control (*Smittsky-ddsinstitutet*, SMI).
